This ongoing Power BI project tracks marketing campaign performance and revenue metrics across multiple channels and client verticals for a leading real estate aggregator company.
The dashboard provides end-to-end visibility into campaign spend, profitability, and conversion efficiency enabling sales managers, marketing managers, finance teams, and senior leadership (VPs) to monitor KPIs in real time and optimize decision-making.

**Business Challenges** - 
The organization runs multi-channel digital campaigns across Google Ads, Meta, Email Blasts, and Partner Portals to attract clients and generate qualified leads.
The business challenge was the lack of a unified view of campaign efficiency, spend vs. profitability, and lead conversion performance.

**Objective** -
- To build a centralized, interactive dashboard that integrates campaign, spend, and performance data to:

- Track campaign effectiveness across regions and channels.

- Analyze client-wise profitability and YoY growth.

- Provide actionable insights to improve lead quality and ROI.

**Data Source & Workflow** - 

Data Source: Monthly marketing and sales data extracted from SharePoint Online (campaign performance folders managed by Marketing & Finance).

Transformation Layer: Data cleaned and modeled in Power Query; metrics standardized across channels and client verticals.

Modeling: Relationships established between tables — Campaigns, Spend, Leads, Channels, and SalesRep — to support advanced DAX measures.

Visualization: Interactive Power BI report published for stakeholder access via the internal workspace.
